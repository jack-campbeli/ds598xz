# DS598xz LuxAI Challenge Project

This repository contains all the necessary code and documentation for our LuxAI challenge project. It is structured to facilitate both development and evaluation of our AI models, specifically designed for competitive play in the LuxAI 2021 competition. Below is a breakdown of the project organization:

## Directories

- `final_submission/`: This directory hosts the final version of our LuxAI agent

- `midterm_submission/`: Contains the project's midterm version, including key Python scripts like `agent_policy.py` for AI decision-making logic.

- `presentation_submission/`: Despite its name, this directory contains an enhanced version of our agent, superior to the one found in `midterm_submission/`, that was developed for our in-class presentation.
